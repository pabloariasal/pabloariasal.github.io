# About

<!--author-->

This blog explores a variety of topics that Iâ€™ve stumbled across in my journey as a software developer. Even though mostly written for my own understanding, my hope is that the curious programmer finds my writings entertaining.

Please contact me in case you find errors or suggestions in a post.

This is a personal blog and views are my own.
